One of the easiest approaches to convert textual information into numbers is the bag-of-words (BoW) model. Using BoW a text is represented by a vector that describes the number of word occurrences in a given text document. The term bag refers to the fact that once the words are put into the unique set of words describing a text, all information about the structure or order of the words in a text is discarded.
